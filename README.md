**torch_brain** is a Python library for various deep learning models designed for neuroscience.

### Features
+ Multi-recording training
+ Optimized data loading with with on-demand data access -- only loads data when needed
+ Advanced samplers that enable arbitrary slicing of data on the fly
+ Advanced data collation strategies including chaining and padding
+ Support for arbitrary neural and behavioral modalities
+ Collection of useful nn.Modules like stitchers, multi-output readouts, infinite vocab embeddings, etc.
+ Collection of neural and behavioral transforms and augmentation strategies
+ Implementations of various deep learning models for neuroscience

### List of implemented models

+ [POYO: A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding (Azabou et al. 2023)](examples/poyo)
+ More coming soon...
